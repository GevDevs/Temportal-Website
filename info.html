			  <h2>What is the goal of this site?</h2>
			  <p>The goal of TEMPORTAL is to offer downloads of classic ROBLOX games that are compatible with their respected client. As a bonus, the site also offers a small selection of multiplayer games that can be played through current-day ROBLOX.</p>
			  <h2>Is there a Discord server?</h2>
			  <p>Yes. You can join the Discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/CsbvJgtusZ">here</a>.</p>
			  <h2>How do I visit places in singleplayer?</h2>
			  <p>To visit a place in singleplayer, you will need to download a client or client launcher to enjoy the game properly. Here are some options for clients.</p>
			  <ul>
			    <li><a href="https://bitl.itch.io/novetus" target="_blank">Novetus (2006S to 2011M)</a></li>

				<li><a href="https://github.com/MaximumADHD/Roblox-2008-Client" target="_blank">Roblox, Mid 2008 (Unpatched)</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/MaximumADHD/Roblox-2009-Client" target="_blank">Roblox, Late 2009 (Unpatched)</a></li>
			  </ul>
			  <p>If you want to play GodoBlocks games, they have to be opened in its dedicated client. You can download the client for Windows, MacOS and Linux <a href="https://godoblocks.neocities.org/install#:~:text=GodoBlocks%20Beta%208.2_02">with this link.</a></p>

			  <!-- <h2>How do I use the Temportal SDK?</h2>
			  <p>The Temportal SDK allows you to use Temportal's multiplayer game engine to create your own neo-classic Roblox games. To use it, the first thing you'll want to do is take both the Temportal SDK model and the Temportal SDK Dependency model.</p>
			  <ul>
			    <li><a href="https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/16143999870">Temportal SDK on Roblox</a></li>
			    <li><a href="https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/16142162914">SDK Dependency</a></li>
			 <p>Next, you'll want to open Roblox studio and add the Temportal SDK to your workspace. There will be a folder that tells you to unpack the folder's contents into StarterPlayerScripts but other than that, you don't need to move the SDK Script or its contents anywhere else.</p>
			  </ul>
			 <p>Configuring the SDK is fairly simple, you can find the configuration options inside of the folder named "CONFIGURATION". The tools folder allows you to set which tools the player will spawn with. The player folder allows you to enable or disable the character select screen, change the logos present in the game and randomize the player colors. Lastly, the miscellaneous folder has the option to disable the classic skybox the SDK comes with.</p> -->
			  <h2>What was GodoBlocks?</h2>
			  <p>GodoBlocks was a 2005 Roblox revival created by myself (Gev) at the end of 2021. Because of my lack of experience in <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a> at the time, the code grew messy and unoptimized. That along with me shifting my interests to making games based on my own original ideas meant GodoBlocks was unfortunately canceled in January of 2023. You can visit the now abandoned website <a href="https://godoblocks.neocities.org/">with this link.</a></p>
